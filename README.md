EX-7: Over-Plotting Reduction Techniques

This repository demonstrates different over-plotting reduction techniques using R programming on a social media interactions dataset.

Over-plotting occurs when many data points overlap in a visualization, making patterns difficult to interpret. This experiment shows practical methods to solve that problem.

🧠 Techniques Covered
1. Alpha Blending

Uses transparency to visualize overlapping points clearly.

2. Jittering

Adds small random noise to data points to reduce overlap.

3. Aggregation & Binning

Groups data into bins and displays density using a heatmap.
